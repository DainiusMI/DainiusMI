### Hello there, I am Dainius


#### A little bit about myself:
I graduated from "Kaunas University of Applied Sciences" in 2012 with a degree in IT. However, for the past 8 years I have worked in manufacturing sector (mainly with AOI). At present, I am unemployed and my mission is to direct my career towards web development.
#### My goals:
Since my studies took place some time ago, I want to freshen up on things I've forgotten and learn the fundamental disciplines necessary to pursue a career as a web developer. In order to do so I am focusing on online courses offered from likes as such as **freeCodeCamp** or **Scrimba**. You can find some of my repositories of their exercises and solo projects bellow at pinned section.

#### Currently I am learning:
- HTML,
- CSS / SCSS,
- JavaScript

#### Certifications I have received so far:
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/DainiusMI/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) @ **freeCodeCamp**
- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/DainiusMI/responsive-web-design) @ **freeCodeCamp**
- [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/DainiusMI/front-end-development-libraries) @ **freeCodeCamp**
