### Hello there, I am Dainius


#### A little bit about myself:
I graduated from "Kaunas University of Applied Sciences" in 2012 with a degree in IT. However, for the past 8 years I have worked in the manufacturing sector (mostly in AOI). At present, I am unemployed and my mission is to direct my career towards web development.
#### My goals:
Since my studies took place some time ago, I want to freshen up on things I've forgotten and learn the fundamental disciplines needed to pursue a career as a web developer. In order to do so I am focusing on online courses offered from likes as such as **freeCodeCamp** or **Scrimba**. You can find my repositories of their exercises and solo projects bellow at pinned section.

#### Currently I am learning:
- HTML5,
- CSS / SCSS,
- JavaScript
